    "description": "Eletia is a high magic world predominantly ruled by the College of Mages, who wield immense power throughout its many kingdoms. The world is connected via magic portals that are scattered among the eight elemental planes which influence many aspects of Eletian life. Adventurers traverse Eletia's lands taking on various magical beasts and relics, and discovering the ancient ruins of fabled civilizations of old that alone controlled magic at its prime. Despite imposed safeguards and alliances between its political entities, Magic drains its untrained users, and black magic lies waiting to engulf the uncautious casters among certain realms endangering numerous infernal predicaments to result over disobeying treaties or doing the forbidden taboo of soul-scarring. Adventure leads the bold ones to discoveries both new and old remembering that loyalties must ever test and bind ere civilization falls into Chaos. Economies and trades thrive around Enchantments, Alchemy, and Reagents.",
